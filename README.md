## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   A Firebase project.
*   A Flutterwave account for payment processing.
*   A local web server. You can use the `http-server` npm package for a quick setup:
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/statwise.git
    cd statwise
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy `env.example.js` to a new file named `env.js`.
    *   Open `env.js` and fill in your Firebase project configuration details in the `firebaseConfig` object.
    *   Add your Flutterwave public key to the `FLWPUBK` constant.

3.  **Update Service Worker Config:**
    *   Open `sw.js` and replace the placeholder `firebaseConfig` object with your own Firebase project configuration.

4.  **Update FCM VAPID Key:**
    *   In `main.js`, find the `initFirebaseMessaging` function.
    *   Replace the placeholder `'YOUR_VAPID_KEY_HERE'` with your actual VAPID key from the Firebase Console (*Project Settings > Cloud Messaging > Web configuration*).

5.  **Run the local server:**
    *   From the root of the project directory, run:
        ```bash
        http-server
        ```
    *   Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by `http-server` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`). You should start at the login page (`/Auth/login.html`).

### Firebase Setup Notes

*   **Authentication:** Enable "Email/Password" as a sign-in method in the Firebase Authentication console.
*   **Firestore:** Your database structure will be created automatically as users sign up and interact with the app. You will need to configure Firestore Security Rules to ensure data is accessed securely.
*   **Storage:** Ensure your Firebase Storage rules allow authenticated users to read and write to their own `profile_pictures/{userId}` path.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

The payment verification logic in this project is designed to be handled by a **Firebase Cloud Function** (`verifyPaymentAndGrantReward`). The client-side code calls this function but does not perform the verification itself. This is the recommended secure approach for production.

For a production environment, you **must** implement this Cloud Function to securely communicate with the Flutterwave API, verify transactions, and grant subscriptions and referral rewards. Client-side verification is insecure and can be easily bypassed.
