## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   A Supabase project.
*   A Flutterwave account for payment processing.
*   A local web server. You can use the `http-server` npm package for a quick setup:
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/statwise.git
    cd statwise
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   The `env.js` file is now auto-generated by a GitHub Actions workflow from repository secrets.
    *   To configure your secrets, navigate to your repository's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
    *   You will need to add the following secrets:
        *   `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
        *   `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase project's public "anon" key.
        *   `FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your Flutterwave public key.
    *   On every push to the `main` branch, the workflow will automatically generate the `env.js` file and commit it to the repository.

3.  **Run the local server:**
    *   From the root of the project directory, run:
        ```bash
        http-server
        ```
    *   Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by `http-server` (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`). You should start at the login page (`/Auth/login.html`).

### Supabase Setup Notes

*   **Authentication:** Enable "Email/Password" as a sign-in method in the Supabase Authentication console.
*   **Database:** Your database structure will be created automatically if you run the `database_schema.sql` file in the Supabase SQL editor. You will need to configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data is accessed securely.
*   **Storage:** Ensure your Supabase Storage rules allow authenticated users to read and write to their own `profile_pictures/{userId}` path.

### ⚠️ Security Warning

The payment verification logic in this project is designed to be handled by a **Supabase Edge Function** (`verifyPaymentAndGrantReward`). The client-side code calls this function but does not perform the verification itself. This is the recommended secure approach for production.

For a production environment, you **must** implement this Edge Function to securely communicate with the Flutterwave API, verify transactions, and grant subscriptions and referral rewards. Client-side verification is insecure and can be easily bypassed.
