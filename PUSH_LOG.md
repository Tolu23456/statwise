Fix applied: 2025-10-31

- Implemented `initializeSearchBar()` and `handleSearchCommand()` in `main.js` and wired it into `initializeHomePage()`.
- Features: Enter to search, commands starting with `/` (e.g. `/c75` filters by confidence >=75, `/odds` sorts by odds), clear button wired.

How to test:
1. Open the app and go to the Home page.
2. Type a team name (e.g., "Arsenal") and press Enter — results should filter to matching cards.
3. Type `/c75` and press Enter — results should show predictions with confidence >= 75%.
4. Type `/odds` and press Enter — results should sort by odds descending.
